Digital art installation for [Spazio 71](https://www.instagram.com/spazio71rimini/) event. Made by [Elisa Dimnaku](mailto:elisadimnaku@gmail.com), Laura Rosati and me.

# Setup

The software is based on [Processing 4](https://processing.org). To execute it you need:

- [Processing 4 video library](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html);
- [KinectPV2 library](https://github.com/ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2);
- a Xbox Kinect v2 connected to the PC and correctly recognized.

Sketch parameters can be found at the top of the sketch code. 

# To do

- [ ] substitute KinectPV2 with [OpenKinect-for-Processing](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing);
- [ ] find some way to be less CPU-intensive (using GPU?).
